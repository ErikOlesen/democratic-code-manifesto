## About

This manifesto outlines principles for building software that doesn't just serve democracy‚Äîit *is* democracy, expressed in executable form. We call this **Democracy as Code**: the practice of embedding democratic principles directly into the architecture, algorithms, and interfaces of our digital systems.

## Read the Manifesto

- **üìñ Online**: [democraticcode.org](https://democraticcode.org) (recommended - includes community activity and discussions)
- **üìÑ Markdown**: [index.md](index.md) (full text, perfect for forking and adapting)
- **üåê Multiple Languages**: See [translations](#translations) below

## The Four Pillars

1. **Democracy is Inclusive** - Technology must lower barriers to participation
2. **Democracy is Private** - Meaningful participation requires psychological safety  
3. **Democracy is Accountable** - Power must be visible, traceable, and answerable
4. **Democracy is Community** - Strengthen social bonds, not atomize users

## Why This Matters

Communities are already organizing on platforms designed for surveillance capitalism, not democratic participation. Food cooperatives coordinate through social media comments. Housing groups make decisions in messaging apps. Activist networks organize through gaming platforms. *These platforms accidentally host democratic processes while systematically undermining democratic values.*

**We get the democracy our tools deserve.** It's time to build tools worthy of the democracy we dream of.

*This manifesto is itself a work in progress, meant to be forked, improved, and adapted by communities around the world. Like democracy itself, it is never finished‚Äîonly continuously practiced.*

**The tools we build today determine the democracy we get tomorrow. Let's build tools worthy of the democracy we dream of.**
